# Developer Tools
Welcome to the Developer Tools repository! This collection of tools is designed to make the lives of developers easier by providing a set of useful utilities and scripts.

# What are Developer Tools?
Developer Tools, also known as web developer tools, are built-in browser features that allow web developers to inspect and debug their web pages. These tools can be used to edit HTML and CSS, analyze website performance, and troubleshoot issues. They can also be used to create and run code snippets on a page, and inspect network requests and server configurations.

# Opening Developer Tools
Developer Tools can be opened in different ways depending on the browser you're using:

Chrome: Right-click on an element on the page and select "Inspect" or press Ctrl+Shift+I (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)
Firefox: Right-click on an element on the page and select "Inspect Element" or press Ctrl+Shift+I (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)
Safari: In the top menu, go to "Develop" > "Show Web Inspector" or press Cmd+Opt+I
Edge: Right-click on an element on the page and select "Inspect Element" or press F12
Elements Tab
The Elements tab allows developers to inspect the HTML and CSS of a web page. It shows the page's Document Object Model (DOM) and lets you edit the HTML and CSS in real-time. Changes made in the Elements tab will be reflected on the webpage, which allows you to experiment with different styles and layouts.

# Auditing a Page
The Audits tab, which is part of the Developer Tools in most browser, uses the Lighthouse tool to analyze a web page's performance, accessibility, and best practices. It provides a report with suggestions on how to improve the page. The report includes information on how to optimize loading speed, make the page more accessible, and improve the overall user experience.

# Creating and Running Snippets
The Developer Tools in most browser include a feature that allows you to create and run code snippets on a page. This feature can be used to test out new code or to automate repetitive tasks. Snippets can be run by selecting them from the Snippets pane or by pressing the Ctrl+Enter(Cmd+Enter for Mac) in the sources tab of developer tools.

# File and Server Information
The Network tab of the developer tools provides information about the requests and responses made by a web page. You can inspect the headers, cookies, and content of each request, which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting issues. This tab also allows you to see the resources loaded by your website such as images, script and css.

# Blocking Requests
Many developer tools also allow you to block requests made by a web page. This can be useful for testing how a page behaves when a specific resource is unavailable or when you want to disable a third-party resource.

# JavaScript and CSS Usage
The Developer Tools in most browser include features that allow you to see how much JavaScript and CSS is used on a page. The Profiler and Performance tab in developer tools can be used to see the amount of memory used by your website and can be used to identify if your website has performance issues.

# Detecting 404 Errors
The Network tab in developer tools can be used to detect 404 errors. You can filter the request by their status and check if any request are returning

# Moving Elements on a Webpage
The Developer Tools in most browser include a feature that allows you to move elements on a web page. This feature can be found in the elements tab, where you can select an element, and then use the DevTools to change its position and layout. This can be useful for quickly experimenting with different designs and layouts without having to make changes to your codebase. You can also use the box model feature in the styles tab to change the size and position of elements using the box model layout.
